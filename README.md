# RL_Finds_NashEquilibrium
Reinforcement Learning to find Nash_Equilibrium of Simple Games

<br />
Current Games: <br />
Prisoners Dilemma (and other similar 2x2 games) - PPO optimizer finds Nash Equilibrium. <br />
two-thirds game - PPO optimizer converges to all agents picking the same random number: Does not find Nash Equilibrium (All agents pick 1)
