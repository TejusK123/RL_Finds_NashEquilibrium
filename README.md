# RL_Finds_NashEquilibrium
Reinforcement Learning to find Nash Equilibrium of Simple Games


## Current Games:
### Prisoners Dilemma (and other similar 2x2 games) - PPO optimizer finds Nash Equilibrium. 
### two-thirds game - PPO optimizer converges to all agents picking the same random number: Does not find Nash Equilibrium (All agents pick 1)
